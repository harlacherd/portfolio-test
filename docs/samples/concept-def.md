# Sample: defining fundamental concepts

Developers within a company are experts on how the company's products operate because they design those products; the customers of that company may not be. Customers need to understand the basic design concepts behind products to be successful with them, even if those concepts might appear basic to an expert user. Here I explain critical concepts for each application space that were previously documented in a perfunctory fashion, if at all.

## <a id="triggers-events"></a>Configure Triggers and Events

You can use triggers and events to coordinate the operation of multiple channels and instruments.

### Triggers

A *trigger* is an input signal received by an instrument or instrument channel that causes the instrument or channel to perform an action. Triggers are routed to *input terminals* to coordinate actions.

An *input terminal* is a physical trigger line, such as a PXI trigger line, or an output terminal on another instrument or channel, where an instrument or channel awaits a digital edge trigger signal.

For purposes of programming instruments with NI APIs, triggers comprise two parts:

- The action, represented with the name of the trigger, that you want the instrument or channel to take.
- The signal condition you want to serve as the stimulus for that action (for example, a rising or falling digital edge on a signal, or a software-generated edge you configure).

Triggers can be internal (software-generated) or external. You can export external triggers and use them with events to synchronize hardware operation with external circuitry or other instruments.

Most NI-DCPower instruments accept external triggers routed between the instruments using PXI trigger lines. Events assigned to a PXI trigger line can coordinate actions across channels and across instruments.

### Events

An *event* is a signal generated by an instrument or instrument channel that indicates a specific operation was completed or a specific state was reached. Events can be routed to *output terminals* to coordinate the action of multiple channels or multiple instruments.

For purposes of programming instruments with NI APIs, you can control three aspects of the pulse that represents each discrete event type:

- Polarity
- Width
- Destination

Event output terminals enable you to route an event signal pulse to external devices. You can modify the polarity and duration of the pulse that is generated when an event occurs to be compatible with trigger inputs of external devices.

You typically configure events for a specific hardware condition and then export those events for use in the test program or export them to a PXI trigger line to cause an action in another instrument configured to wait for a trigger on the same PXI trigger line.

## <a id="analyze-generate-vst"></a>Analyzing and Generating RF Signals with NI VSTs

In broad terms, NI VSTs are designed to receive (analyze) and output (generate) RF signals. To do this, NI VSTs use separate instrument drivers—NI-RFSA, NI-RFSG—as well as RFmx and other purpose-built applications that enable specific measurement types.

The documentation in this manual focuses on programming your hardware using the NI-RFSA, NI-RFSG, and RFmx APIs.

You can use the following software to control your NI VST:

- **NI-RFSA**: Instrument driver that provides API-level control over RF signal analysis functionality
- **NI-RFSG**: Instrument driver that provides API-level control over RF signal generation functionality
- **RFmx**: Advanced measurement software for RF test systems that includes personalities and purpose-built applications. Each *personality* enables a specific family of RF measurements via a soft front panel and a programmatic API; the API allows you to access signal analysis functionality of the personality in test programs.

Each API has its own programming flow you need to understand to successfully control your VST and meet the needs of your RF application.

In addition to NI-RFSA, NI-RFSG, and RFmx, NI provides high-level applications to control RF instruments:

- **InstrumentStudio**: Interactive soft front panel application that, for NI RF instruments, surfaces the functionality of NI-RFSG, NI-RFSA, and RFmx; also supports other instrument types
- **Application-specific RF software**: Purpose-built application environments for specific RF testing workflows, such as RFIC test

Refer to the documentation for these applications for information on using them with NI RF hardware.

**Note:** Your instrument must have the appropriate hardware option—for generation, analysis, or both—to access associated functionality in your programs.
